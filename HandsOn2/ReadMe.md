ðŸ§© Problem: Build a Type-Safe Unit Converter in Go
Write a Go program that performs simple unit conversions involving length, temperature, and weight. The goal is to demonstrate your understanding of Go's strong static type system, type inference, and type conversion rules.
Your program should:
* Perform conversions between meters and feet, Celsius and Fahrenheit, and kilograms and pounds.
* Use a mix of explicit type declarations and type inference (:=) to define variables.
* Include type conversions to safely handle operations between different types (e.g., int and float64).
* Show how Go enforces compile-time type safety by preventing operations between mismatched types unless explicitly converted.
  The output should display the original values and their converted equivalents in a clear, human-readable format.

10.00 meters is 32.81 feet
25.00Â°C is 77.00Â°F
70 kg is 154.32 pounds
Multiplying 5 and 2.50 gives 12.50
